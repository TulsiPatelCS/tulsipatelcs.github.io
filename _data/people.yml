    include Misinformation Usable Security and Privacy Authentication and Mobile HCI.
    His recent research focuses on misinformation both from a data-driven and human
    aspects perspective. In his previous role at New York University Abu Dhabi he
    was involved in various projects that studied the countering of misinformation
    and the spreading of cross-platform multimodal misinformation. In his position
    at the University of New South Wales his research focused on designing privacy-enhancing
    technologies that provide users with realistic information to anonymize their
    online identities. Dr. Micallef obtained his PhD from Glasgow Caledonian University
    United Kingdom. In his PhD he investigated the use of mobile sensing to improve
    the usability of smartphone authentication. "'
