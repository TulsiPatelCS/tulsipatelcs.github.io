    was involved in various projects that studied the countering of misinformation
    and the spreading of cross-platform multimodal misinformation. In his position
    at the University of New South Wales his research focused on designing privacy-enhancing
    technologies that provide users with realistic information to anonymize their
    online identities. Dr. Micallef obtained his PhD from Glasgow Caledonian University
    United Kingdom. In his PhD he investigated the use of mobile sensing to improve
    the usability of smartphone authentication. "'

    focused approach to investigate how to empower rare disease patients during their
    journey towards diagnosis. More specifically, it will explore whether a machine
    learning based platform can enable rare disease patients to have earlier discussions
    with their healthcare providers and provide patients with a stronger voice in
    their journey towards diagnosis.

  role: academic
  bio: Dr. Muneeb Ahmad joined the Department of Computer Science as Lecturer at Swansea
    University in 2020. His research focuses on employing methods from the field of
    human-centred design to create intelligent interactive systems such as social
    robots, and user interfaces that can adapt to users through real-time analysis
    of their social signals and physiological data. He is interested in the applications
    of machine learning to implement intelligent interactive systems. The work further
    involves evaluation of these interactive systems to study their impact on human
    behaviour mainly to see their level of social engagement, cognitive load, perceived
    trust, and performance. Prior to joining Swansea University, He has worked as
    a Research Associate at the Edinburgh Centre for Robotics in the Department of
    Computer Science at the Heriot-Watt University on the EPSRC ORCA-Hub project,
    where he led the development of a measurement of Cognitive load in the Human-Robotic/Computer
