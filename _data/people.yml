  role: academic
  bio: Dr. Muneeb Ahmad joined the Department of Computer Science as Lecturer at Swansea
    University in 2020. His research focuses on employing methods from the field of
    human-centred design to create intelligent interactive systems such as social
    robots, and user interfaces that can adapt to users through real-time analysis
    of their social signals and physiological data. He is interested in the applications
    of machine learning to implement intelligent interactive systems. The work further
    involves evaluation of these interactive systems to study their impact on human
    behaviour mainly to see their level of social engagement, cognitive load, perceived
    trust, and performance. Prior to joining Swansea University, He has worked as
    a Research Associate at the Edinburgh Centre for Robotics in the Department of
    Computer Science at the Heriot-Watt University on the EPSRC ORCA-Hub project,
    where he led the development of a measurement of Cognitive load in the Human-Robotic/Computer
