His research interests include Misinformation, Usable Security and Privacy, Authentication, and Mobile HCI. His recent research focuses on misinformation, both from a data-driven and human aspects perspective. In his previous role at New York University Abu Dhabi, he was involved in various projects that studied the countering of misinformation and the spreading of cross-platform multimodal misinformation. In his position at the University of New South Wales his research focused on designing privacy-enhancing technologies that provide users with realistic information to anonymize their online identities. Dr. Micallef obtained his PhD from Glasgow Caledonian University, United Kingdom. In his PhD he investigated the use of mobile sensing to improve the usability of smartphone authentication.

Previously he has designed digital products and services with empathy focusing on users’ needs. He did his postgraduate and undergraduate studies in Human-Centred Design (HCD) and Electronics Engineering in India.His HCI journey started at the INTERACT 2017 conference, where he was a student volunteer. His first formal introduction went beyond User Experience (UX). Since then, he has led initiatives enabling students and practitioners to share knowledge and build professional relationships.Since 2018, he has also been involved with India HCI, the annual HCI conference in cooperation with ACM. He has been building a community across borders in South Asia involving professionals, researchers, and many SIGCHI members from India, Banglades,Sri Lanka & Pakistan. He is passionate about building bridges between Global North and Global South. His area of interest lies in Human-Centred AI, Mixed Reality, ICTD, Design Research, Ethics and Algorithms.",https://swanseauniversity-my.sharepoint.com/personal/m_j_roach_swansea_ac_uk/Documents/Apps/Microsoft%20Forms/Human%20Centred%20Research%20Web%20presence%20form/Question/Pranjal%20Jain%202021_PRANJAL%20JAIN.jpg,Human Centred Design;Human-Centred AI Interaction;Tangible User Interfaces;Useable Security and Privacy;Digital Economy;,PGR,https://www.pranjaljain.in/
