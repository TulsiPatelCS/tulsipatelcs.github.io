Together with colleagues, I studied practices in sharing research materials and eye movement behaviour in research reading. We also developed tools for designing experiments, determining the sample size, and choosing statistical analysis procedures. I previously taught courses and gave lectures in quantitative research methods, including a course at the ACM CHI conference in 2022—which is one of the top conferences in the field of Human–Computer Interaction. I co-organize the community-led group of Transparent Statistics in Human–Computer Interaction. We organize events at ACM CHI and IEEE VIS conferences related to this topic. Key output includes the addition of Transparency aspect in the CHI reviewing guidelines, and the Transparent Statistics Guideline (work-in-progress).
