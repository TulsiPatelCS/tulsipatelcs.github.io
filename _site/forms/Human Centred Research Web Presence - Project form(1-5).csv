If harnessed!! experts' experiences and practices could help novice employees do their work efficiently. Understanding experts' experiences and intuition could help organisations maintain critical knowledge!! known as tacit knowledge. Through tacit knowledge!! organisations could aggregate learnings and cooperate to produce faster and more efficient results. To further advance the concept of tacit knowledge!! Swansea University and British Telecom (BT) would explore different methods to capture physiological data and evaluate the possibility of Artificial Intelligence in the collective management and distribution of tacit knowledge. Through this collaboration!! we would recommend human-centred design methods that would help characterise experts' tacit knowledge and capture it through non-intrusive ways.,https://swanseauniversity-my.sharepoint.com/personal/m_j_roach_swansea_ac_uk/Documents/Apps/Microsoft%20Forms/Human%20Centred%20Research%20Web%20Presence%20form%201/Question/Analysis_P024x_PRANJAL%20JAIN.jpg,,,Simon Robinson!!

Currently!! this research is in its early stages!! and so the work we are carrying out has an emphasis on examining the clinical workflow of radiologists and their interactions with technology. We are simultaneously carrying out two studies: an observational study whereby we have little-to-know interaction with the radiologist and simply examine the process of making a report in order to gather an outsider perspective on the process!! and a workshop where we involve the clinician in explaining their workflow and how technology impacts their work. Between these two studies we can garner both impartial and partial perspectives on how radiologists carry out their work to develop an in depth understanding of the role of technology in the field.,,,,Martin Porcheron!!

Many strategies are shams: misinformation!! misleading!! laden with conflict of interest or informed by outdated science. For the strategies that are supported by science!! results from scientific experiments and Randomized-Control Trials (RCT) come with much uncertainty as some people inevitably fall in the inferior tail of the Gaussian distribution. Thus!! some evidence-based techniques do not work for some individuals for a variety of reasons!! including genetic disposition!! social!! economic!! and cultural contexts. Consequently!! people generally make their decisions on a trial-and-error basis. When an individual finds that a science-based strategy is ineffective for them!! the disappointment could lead to scepticism or distrust in science. Thus!! helping individuals systematically investigate the choices for their inner transformation will benefit both themselves and their society.  One solution is N-of-1 experiments!! where all experimental conditions are applied to an individual over time!! and outcomes are repeatedly measured. However!! N-of-1 experiments are difficult to carry out —especially for the population at large —as individuals lack the knowledge and frameworks to guide this process and face difficulties in formulating experimental conditions!! operationalising measurements!! and designing experiments.  We aim to empower individuals to use N-of-1 experiments to improve their life. We believe that it is possible to create a platform that can be used with N-of-1 experiments across health and wellbeing practices. Therefore!! this project is driven by the following research questions: What are the challenges people face when engaging in N-of-1 experiments!! and what characteristics of platforms can address these challenges?,,,,Chat Wacharamanotham!!

The developed system consists of bespoke LiDAR sensing technology!! air and noise pollution sensing combined with Artificial Intelligence (AI)!! a wireless mesh network based on THREAD protocol and gateway devices for external connectivity.   The main objectives were to produce a hardware prototype device that consists of a LIDAR sensor!! air quality monitoring sensors and acoustic sensors; Deployment of a real-world pilot and capture data; Integrate Vortex Air Quality Monitoring Wireless Mesh Network with the  BT network infrastructure and establish data connectivity across the BT network; To develop an AI model for vehicle detection and classification; Integrate the AI model and real-world data analysis based on use cases; To carry out exploitation and dissemination activities.,,,,Dr Kayal Lakshmanan!!
