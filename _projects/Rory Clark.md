The goal of this project is to provide the NHS with a clinical framework that allows for high level evaluation and implementation of novel Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning technology in radiology; this is traditionally a complex and arduous process that requires an in-depth knowledge of the discipline, but our aim is to develop a framework that allows for quicker and safer adoption of new systems to allow the NHS to keep up with the rapidly digitising world of health sciences.  Currently, this research is in its early stages, and so the work we are carrying out has an emphasis on examining the clinical workflow of radiologists and their interactions with technology. We are simultaneously carrying out two studies: an observational study whereby we have little-to-know interaction with the radiologist and simply examine the process of making a report in order to gather an outsider perspective on the process, and a workshop where we involve the clinician in explaining their workflow and how technology impacts their work. Between these two studies we can garner both impartial and partial perspectives on how radiologists carry out their work to develop an in depth understanding of the role of technology in the field.
