I"<p>Much intangible knowledge in terms of experiences and intuitions in a large industrial setting is confined to experts, making it inaccessible for organisations to capitalise on by improving their workflow. If harnessed, experts’ experiences and practices could help novice employees do their work efficiently. Understanding experts’ experiences and intuition could help organisations maintain critical knowledge, known as tacit knowledge. Through tacit knowledge, organisations could aggregate learnings and cooperate to produce faster and more efficient results. To further advance the concept of tacit knowledge, Swansea University and British Telecom (BT) would explore different methods to capture physiological data and evaluate the possibility of Artificial Intelligence in the collective management and distribution of tacit knowledge. Through this collaboration, we would recommend human-centred design methods that would help characterise experts’ tacit knowledge and capture it through non-intrusive ways.</p>
